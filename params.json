  "body": "Nette Starter\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest pre-packaged and pre-configured application using the [Nette](https://nette.org)\r\nthat you can use as the starting point for your new applications.\r\n\r\n[Nette](https://nette.org) is a popular tool for PHP web development.\r\nIt is designed to be the most usable and friendliest as possible. It focuses\r\non security and performance and is definitely one of the safest PHP frameworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe best way to install Web Project is using Composer. If you don't have Composer yet,\r\ndownload it following [the instructions](https://doc.nette.org/composer). Then use command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncomposer create-project nette/sandbox path/to/install --prefer-dist\r\ncd path/to/install\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake directory `temp/` writable.\r\n```sh\r\nchmod -R a+rw temp\r\n```\r\n\r\nWeb Server Setup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nphp -S localhost:8000 -t www\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the welcome page.\r\n\r\nFor Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you\r\nshould be ready to go.\r\n\r\nIt is CRITICAL that whole `app/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly\r\nvia a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nPHP 5.3.1 or higher.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n- Nette: New BSD License or GPL 2.0 or 3.0\r\n",
